# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
A time-efficient hybrid design for emotion recognition using facial expression is proposed, combining image pre-processing steps and different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structures providing better accuracy and greatly improved training time. Seven
basic emotions of human expression (i.e. sadness, happiness, disgust, anger, fear, surprise and neutral) are predicted. The experiment to test the model will be conducted using MMA
Facial Expression database and different facial orientations. Performance evaluation will be done by cross-validation techniques to avoid bias towards a specific set of images from a
database. And finally, a Web application will be developed to make it real-time more user friendly.
